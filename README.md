# SudokuSolver
A program that solves sudoku puzzles

Simply enter the numbers from a puzzle into the appropriate space and click solve. This solves puzzles using the same basic logic a human would rather than brute foce or trial and error strategies. 
I did not implement the more advanced elimination logic so it cannot solve every puzzle. I originally wanted to add additional functions to allow for that but also had the idea to turn this into a teaching tool rather than just a solving program. 
As such I don't like that it's written in python as it's much harder to distribute that way so I'll be remaking it once I know a compiled language (learning Golang now so that'll happen soon enough).
